Strategy Pattern:

Strategy design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple
algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.

Strategy pattern is also known as Policy Pattern. We define multiple algorithms and let client application pass the
algorithm to be used as a parameter. One of the best example of strategy pattern is Collections.sort() method that
takes Comparator parameter. Based on the different implementations of Comparator interfaces, the Objects are getting
sorted in different ways.
=============================================================

when to use:

1-Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to
switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
2-Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
3-Use the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not
be as important in the context of that logic.
4-Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional operator that switches between different variants of the
same algorithm.
=============================================================

Common user cases:

Algorithms
Payment Processing
Product Pricing
Text Formatting
Compression Algorithms
Routing
=============================================================

Pros

You can swap algorithms used inside an object at runtime.
You can isolate the implementation details of an algorithm from the code that uses it.
You can replace inheritance with composition.
Open/Closed Principle.You can introduce new strategies without having to change the context.
=============================================================

Cons

If you only have a couple of algorithms, and they rarely change, thereâ€™s no real reason to overcomplicate the program
with new classes and interfaces that come along with the pattern.

Clients must be aware of the differences between strategies to be able to select a proper one.
